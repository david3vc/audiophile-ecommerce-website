- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
    - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
    - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping.
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary.
